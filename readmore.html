			<p>SAP-l is a computer because it stores a program and data before calculations begin; 
			then it automatically carries out the program instructions without human intervention. And yet, 
			SAP-l is a primitive computing machine. It compares to a modem computer the way a Neanderthal 
			human would compare to a modem person. Something is missing, something found in every modem computer. 
			SAP-2 is the next step in the evolution toward modem computers because it includes jump instructions. 
			These new instructions force the computer to repeat or skip part of a program. As you will discover, 
			jump instructions open up a whole new world of computing power.</p>

		<a name = "bidreg"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">BIDIRECTIONAL REGISTERS</h3></a>
			<p>To reduce the wiring capacitance of SAP-2, we will run only one set of wires between each register and 
			the bus. Figure 11-la shows the idea. The input and output pins are shorted; only one group of wires is 
			connected to the bus. Does this shorting the input and output pins ever cause trouble? No. During a computer 
			run, either LOAD or ENABLE may be active, but not both at the same time. An active LOAD means that a binary 
			word flows from the bus to the register input; during a load operation, the output lines are floating. On the 
			other hand, an active ENABLE means that a binary word flows from the register to the bus; in this case, the 
			input lines float. The IC manufacturer can internally connect the input and output pins of a three-state register. 
			This not only reduces the wiring capacitance; it also reduces the number of 110 pins. For instance, Fig. ll-lb 
			has four 110 pins instead of eight. Figure II-Ie is the symbol for a three-state register with internally connected 
			input and output pins. The doubleheaded arrow reminds us that the path is bidirectional; data can move either way.</p>
		<a name = "archi"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">ARCHITECTURE</h3></a>
			<p>Figure 11-2 shows the architecture of SAP-2. All register outputs to the W bus are three state; those not 
			connected to the bus are two-state. As before, the controller-sequencer sends control signals (not shown) to each 
			register. These control signals load, enable, or otherwise prepare the register for the next positive clock edge. 
			A brief description of each box is given now.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Input Ports</h4>
			<p>SAP-2 has two input ports, numbered 1 and 2. A hexadecimal keyboard encoder is connected to port 1. 
			It allows us to enter hexadecimal instructions and data through port.</p>
			<ol><li> Notice that the hexadecimal keyboard encoder sends a READY signal to bit 0 of port 2. This signal 
					  indicates when the data in port 1 is valid. Also notice the SERIAL IN signal going to pin 7 of port</li>
				<li>A later example will show you how to convert serial input data to parallel data.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Program Counter</h4>
			<p>This time, the program counter has 16 bits; therefore, it can count from</p>
			<p>PC = 0000 0000 0000 0000 to PC = 1111 1111 1111 1111</p>
			<p>This is equivalent to 0000H to FFFFH, or decimal 0 to 65,535. A low CLR signal resets the PC before each computer 
			run; so the data processing starts with the instruction stored in memory location OOOOH.</p>
			<img id = "PC" src="C:\Users\Capatan\Desktop\sap2 html\bidirection.png" >
			<p>Fig. 11.1 Bidirectional register.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">MAR and Memory</h4>
			<p>During the fetch cycle, the MAR receives 16-bit addresses from the program counter. The two-state MAR output then 
			addresses the desired memory location. The memory has a 2K ROM with addresses of 0000Hto 07FFH. This ROM contains a 
			program called a monitor that initializes the computer on power-up, interprets the keyboard inputs, and so forth. The 
			rest of the memory is a 62K RAM with addresses from 0800H to FFFFH.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Memory Data Register</h4>
			<p>The memory data register (MDR) is an 8-bit buffer register. Its output sets up the RAM. The memory data register 
			receives data from the bus before a write operation, and it sends data to the bus after a read operation.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Instruction Register</h4>
			<p>Because SAP-2 has more instructions than SAP-I, we will use 8 bits for the op code rather than 4. An 8-bit op code 
			can accommodate 256 instructions. SAP-2 has only 42 instructions, so there will be no problem coding them with 8 bits. 
			Using an 8-bit op code also allows upward compatibility with the 8080/8085 instruction set because it is based on an 
			8-bit op code. As mentioned earlier, all SAP instructions are identical with 8080/8085 instructions.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Controller-Sequencer</h4>
			<p>The controller-sequencer produces the control words or microinstructions that coordinate and direct the rest of 
			the computer. Because SAP-2 has a bigger instruction set, the controller-sequencer has more hardware. Although the 
			CON word is bigger, the idea is the same: the control word or microinstruction determines how the registers react to 
			the next positive clock edge.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Accumulator</h4>
			<p>The two-state output of the accumulator goes to the ALU; the three-state output to the W bus. Therefore, the 8-bit 
			word in the accumulator continuously drives the ALU, but this same word appears on the bus only when EA is active</p>
		
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">ALU and Flags</h4>
			<p>Standard ALUs are commercially available as integrated circuits. These ALUs have 4 or more control bits that determine 
			the arithmetic or logic operation performed on words A and B. The ALU used in SAP-2 includes arithmetic and logic operations. 
			In this book a flag is a flip-flop that keeps track of a changing condition during a computer run. The SAP-2 computer has 
			two flags. The sign flag is set when the accumulator contents become negative during the execution of some instructions. 
			The zero flag is set when the accumulator contents become zero.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">TMP, B, and C Registers</h4>
			<p>Instead of using the B register to hold the data being added or subtracted from the accumulator, a temporary (TMP) 
			register is used. This allows us more freedom in using the B register. Besides the TMP and B registers, SAP-2 includes a C 
			register. This gives us more flexibility in moving data during a computer run.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Output Ports</h4>
			<p>SAP-2 has two output ports, numbered 3 and 4. The of the accumulator can be loaded into port 3, which drives a hexadecimal 
			display. This allows us to see the processed data. The contents of the accumulator can also be sent to port 4. Notice that 
			pin 7 of port 4 sends an ACKNOWLEDGE signal to the hexadecimal encoder. This ACKNOWLEDGE signal and the READY signal are part 
			of a concept called handshaking, to be discussed later. Also notice the SERIAL OUT signal from pin 0 of port 4; one of the 
			examples will show you how to convert parallel data in the accumulator into serial output data.</p>
		<a name = "memref"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">MEMORY-REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS</h3></a>
			<p>The SAP-2 fetch cycle is the same as before. <em>T1</em> is the address state, <em>T2</em> is the increment state, and <em>T3</em> is the memory state. 
			All SAP-2 instructions therefore use the memory during the fetch cycle because a program instruction is transferred from the 
			memory to the instruction register.</p>
			<p>During the execution cycle, however, the memory may or may not be used; it depends on the type of instruction that has been 
			fetched. A memory-reference instruction (MRI) is one that uses the memory during the execution cycle. The SAP-2 computer has 
			an instruction set with 42 instructions. What follows is a description of the memory reference instructions.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">LDA and STA</h4>
			<p>LDA has the same meaning as before: <em>load the accumulator</em> with the addressed memory data. The only difference is that 
			more memory locations can be accessed in SAP-2 because the addresses are from 0000H to FFFFH. For example, LDA 2000H means 
			to load the accumulator with the contents of memory location 2000H.</p>
			<p>To distinguish the different parts of an instruction, the mnemonic is sometimes called the <em>op code</em> and the rest of the 
			instruction is known as the <em>operand</em>. With LDA 2000H, LDA is the op code and 2000H is the operand. Therefore, "op code" has 
			a double meaning in microprocessor work; it may stand for the mnemonic or for the binary code used to represent the mnemonic. 
			The intended meaning is clear from the context. </p>
			<p>STA is a mnemonic for <em>store the accumulator</em>. Every STA instruction needs an address. STA 7FFFH means to store the accumulator 
			contents at memory location 7FFFH. </p>
			<p>If A = 8AH the execution of STA 7FFFH stores 8AH at address 7FFFH.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">MVI</h4>
			<p>MVI is the mnemonic for move immediate. It tells the computer to load a designated register with the byte that immediately follows the op code. 
			For instance, MVI A,37H tells the computer to load the accumulator with 37H. After this instruction has been executed, the binary contents of the 
			accumulator are A = 0011 0111</p>
			<p>You can use MVI with the A, B, and C registers. The formats for these instructions are
			MVI A,byte
			MVI B,byte
			MVI C,byte</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Op Codes</h4>
			<p>Table 11-1 shows the op codes for the SAP-2 instruction set. These are the 8080/8085 op codes. As you can see, 3A is the op code for LDA, 
			32 is the op code for STA, etc. Refer to this table in the remainder of this chapter.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:20px">TABLE 11-1. SAP-2 OP CODES</h4>
			<img class = "opcodetable" src="C:\Users\Capatan\Desktop\sap2 html\sapopcodes.png">
			<a name = "regin"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">REGISTER INSTRUCTIONS</h3></a>
			<p>	Memory-reference instructions are relatively slow because they require more than one memory access during the instruction cycle. 
			Furthermore ,we often want to move data directly from one register to another without having to go through the memory.  What follows 
			are some of the SAP 2 register instructions, designed to move data from one register to another in the shortest possible time.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">MOV</h4>
			<p>MOV is the mnemonic for <em>move</em>. It tells the computer to move data from one register to another.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">ADD/SUB</h4>
			<p>	ADD stands for add the data in the designated register to the accumulator. Similarly, SUB means subtract the data in the designated 
			register form the accumulator.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">INR/DCR </h4>
			<p>INR is the mnemonic for <em>increment</em>; It tells the computer to increment the designated register. DCR is the mnemonic for <em>decrement</em>, 
			and it instructs the computer to decrement the designated register.</p>
			<a name = "jump"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">JUMP AND CALL INSTRUCTIONS</h3></a>
			<p>SAP-2 has four jump instructions; these can change the program sequence. In other words, instead of fetching the next instruction in the 
			usual way, the computer may jump or branch to another part of the program.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">JMP</h4>
			<p>JMP is the mnemonic for jump; it tells the computer to get the next instruction from the designated memory location. Every JMP 
			instruction includes an address that is loaded into the program counter.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">JM</h4>
			<p>SAP-2 has two flags called the sign flag and the zero flag. During the execution of some instruction, these flags will be set or 
			reset depending on what happens to the accumulator contents. If the accumulator contents become negative the sign flag will be set ; otherwise 
			the sign flag is cleared. JM is the mnemonic for  jump if minus; the computer will jump to a designated address if and only if the sign flag is set</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">JZ</h4>
			<p>JZ is the mnemonic for jump if zero; it tells the computer to jump to the designated address only if the zero flag is set.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">JNZ</h4>
			<p>JNZ is the mnemonic for jump if not zero; in this case we get a jump when the zero flag is clear and no jump when it is set.</p>
			<p>JM, JZ and JNZ are called <em>conditional jumps</em> because the program jump occurs only if certain conditions are satisfied. On the other hand JMP is 
			unconditional; once this instruction is fetched , the execution cycle always jumps the program to the specified address.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">CALL </h4>
			<p>Is the mnemonic for <em>call the subroutine</em>.  Every CALL instruction must include the starting address of the desired subroutine</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">RET</h4>
			<p>Stands for <em>return</em>. It is used at the end of every subroutine to tell the computer to go back to the original program.</p>
			<a name = "logic"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">LOGIC INSTRUCTIONS</h3></a>
			<p>A microprocessor can do logic as well as arithmetic. They are a subset of the 8080/8085 instructions.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">CMA</h4>
			<p>CMA stands for "complement the accumulator". The execution of a CMA inverts each bit in the accumulator, producing the 1's complement.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">ANA</h4>
			<p>ANA means "AND the accumulator" contents with the designated register. The result is stored in the accumulator.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">ORA</h4>
			<p>ORA is the mnemonic for "OR the accumulator" with designated register. The two ORA instruction in SAP-2 are ORA-B and ORA-C.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">XRA</h4>
			<p>Means "XOR the accumulator" content with the designated register. The SAP-2 instruction sets contain XRA B and XRA C.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">ANI</h4>
			<p>ANI means "AND immediate". It tells the computer to AND the accumulator contents with the byte that immediately follows the op code.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">ORI</h4>
			<p>Is the mnemonic for "OR immediate". The accumulator contents are ORed with the byte that follows the op code.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">XRI</h4>
			<p>Means "XOR immediate".</p>
			<a name = "other"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">OTHER INSTRUCTIONS</h3></a>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">NOP</h4>
			<p>Stands for "no operation". During the execution of NOP, all T states are do nothings. Therefore, no register changes occur 
			during a NOP. It is used to waste time. It takes four T states to fetch and execute the NOP instruction. By repeating a NOP a number of 
			times, we can delay the data processing, which is useful in timing operations.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">HLT </h4>
			<p>HLT stands for <em>halt</em>. It ends the data processing.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">IN </h4>
			<p>It is the mnemonic for <em>input</em>. It tells the computer to transfer data from the designated port to the accumulator. Since there are 
			two input ports, you have to designate which one is being used. The format for an input operation is IN byte.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">OUT </h4>
			<p>Stands for output. When this instruction is executed, the accumulator word is loaded into the designated output port. The format for an output operation is OUT byte.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">RAL</h4>
			<p>RAL is the mnemonic for “rotate the accumulator left”.  This instruction will shift all bits to the left and move the MSB into the LSB position.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">RAR</h4>
			<p>RAR stands for "rotate the accumulator right". This time, the bits shift to the right, the LSB going to the MSB position. </p>
			<a name = "summary"><h1 style="color:#00CCFF">SAP-2 Summary</h3></a>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">T-states</h4>
			<p>The SAP-2 controller-sequencer is micro programmed with a variable machine cycle. This means that some instructions take longer than others 
			to execute. Knowing the number of T states is important in timing applications.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Flags</h4>
			<p>Not all instructions affect the flags. The instructions that update the flags are ADD, ANA, ANI, DCR, INR, ORA, ORI, SUB, XRA and XRI.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Conditional Jumps</h4>
			<p>The conditional jumps taken ten T states when the jump occur but only seven T states when no jump take place. During the execution cycle the address ROM sends the 
			computer to the starting address of a conditional-jump micro routine. The initial microinstruction looks at the flags and judges whether or not to jump. If a jump is indicated, 
			the micro routine continues; otherwise, it is aborted and the computer begins a new fetch cycle.</p>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Addressing Modes </h4>
			<p>The SAP-2 instructions access data in different ways. It is the operand that tells us how the data is to be accessed.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Direct Addressing - the address is specified where the data is to be found.</li>
				<li>Immediate addressing - instead of giving the address for the data, we give the data itself. </li>
				<li>Register Addressing - the data to be loaded is stored in the CPU register rather than in the memory. 
				Register addressing has the advantage of speed because fewer T states are needed for this type of instruction.</li>
				<li>Implied Addressing - means that the location of the data is contained within the op code itself.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 style = "font-size:25px">Bytes</h4>
			<p>Each instruction occupies a number of bytes in the memory. SAP-2 instructions are either  1, 2, or 3 bytes long.</p>
